This repository contains two deep learning projects, focusing on image classification tasks. Each project utilizes different datasets and neural network architectures, demonstrating the application of machine learning in image recognition.

## Project 1: Cat and Dog Image Classification
Objective: To evaluate the impact of neural network architecture and its depth on model accuracy, using the "Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition" dataset.

Key Findings: ResNet architectures and their derivatives outperform VGG models.

## Project 2: Number Image Classification
Objective: To develop an effective deep learning model for binary classification of number images, using numbers 0 and 1 from the MNIST dataset.

Major Achievements: Achieved a classification accuracy of 90% through optimization of network architecture and hyperparameter tuning.
